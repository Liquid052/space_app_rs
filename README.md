# Space App

A celestial simulation built with space_engine that demonstrates gravitational
dynamics in space. The application visualizes a system with a planet, its orbiting moon,
and a spaceship (represented by a yellow triangle that points along its trajectory).
The simulation shows these bodies respond to the gravitational influence of an approaching asteroid with
enough mass to alter their trajectories.
